\section{Introduction}

Purpose of this experimental package is to prevent paragraph overflow in
LuaTeX. Sometimes, TeX cannot find good points for line-breaking. This results
in lines where part of words stick out of the paragraph shape. Linebreaker
tries to prevent that using repeated execution of the line-breaking algorithm
with different values for parameters which are taken into account in this
process.

Example of use:

 \linebreakerdisable
% \noindent\begin{minipage}{220pt}
 \def\testtext{%
The example document given below creates two pages by using Lua code alone. You
will learn how to access TeX's boxes and counters from the Lua side, shipout a
page into the PDF file, create horizontal and vertical boxes (hbox and vbox),
create new nodes and manipulate the nodes links structure. The example covers
the following node types: rule, whatsit, vlist, hlist and action.

\section{Some background}

This repository contains experimental line-breaking callback for LuaTeX engine (
it should work with any format). Motivation for this was a
\href{http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/200989/2891}{question} by Frank Mittelbach on
TeX.sx. His idea is to rewrite \TeX\ paragraph building algorithm in Lua, in
order to support river detection and similar tasks, unsupported by standard TeX
line-breaking algorithm.

As complete rewrite of line-breaking algorithm seems to be huge task, I tried
different approach. LuaTeX provides several callbacks for working with node lists. 
There callbacks are called when some actions on the node lists happens. For
example ligaturing, kerning, before line-breaking, after line-breaking and
callback for doing the line-breaking. There is a `tex.linebreak` function, which takes
node list and table with TeX parameters (`lineskip`, `baselineskip`, `tolerance`,
etc.) New node list with lines broken into horizontal boxes is returned by this
function.

My idea is to process this returned node list, detect problems and call
`tex.linebreak` with different parameters if problems were detected. At the
moment, overflow box detection works somehow, river detection is a proof of
concept and it needs further corrections.
